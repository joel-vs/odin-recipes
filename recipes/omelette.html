    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An omelet is a dish you might order for breakfast or brunch — it's kind of 
        like a folded pancake made of beaten eggs, sometimes with the addition of 
        vegetables, cheese, or meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Master the omelette with our simple recipe then add the filling of your choice – 
        grated cheese, ham, fresh herbs, mushrooms and smoked salmon are favourites.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter 
            in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has 
            melted and is foaming.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to 
            another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. 
            Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrape a line through the 
            middle with a spatula.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. 
            Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like – some grated 
            cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work 
            well. Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in 
            half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>

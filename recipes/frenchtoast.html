    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French toast is a dish of bread slices soaked in beaten eggs and milk or cream, 
        then pan-fried. The outsides turn golden brown and crispy, while 
        the insides remain soft. French toast is often served with fresh 
        fruit and orange juice.

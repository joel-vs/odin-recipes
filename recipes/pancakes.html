    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, 
        often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that 
        may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as 
        a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. 
        It is a type of batter bread.

            In medium bowl or measuring cup, whisk together milk, egg, and 
            oil until smooth. In large bowl, whisk together pancake mix and 
            sugar; make well in center and gradually whisk in milk mixture 
            until mostly smooth (some small lumps are OK).

            Heat large nonstick skillet or griddle on medium until drop of water sizzles. 
            In batches, add scant 1/4-cupfuls of batter. Cook until surface is bubbly and 
            edges are set, 2 to 3 minutes. With wide spatula, gently flip; 
            cook 1 to 2 minutes. Serve right away or keep warm on baking sheet 
            in 225°F oven.
